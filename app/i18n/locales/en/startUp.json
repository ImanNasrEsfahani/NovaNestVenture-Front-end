    "differences-detail" : "While all startups begin their journey as small businesses, their ultimate goals differ significantly. Their primary objective is to transcend their initial \"startup\" status and establish themselves as dominant players in their chosen markets. In contrast, many small businesses prioritize stability and profitability within a defined niche. They focus on organic growth, customer satisfaction, and sustainable operations. Their owners are often content with their current scale and may not actively seek aggressive expansion. Startups operate with a go big or go home\" mentality, while small businesses prioritize longevity and consistent returns",
