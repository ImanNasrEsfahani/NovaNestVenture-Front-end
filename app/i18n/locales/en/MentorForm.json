      "Since 2017, NovaNest has been on a mission to accelerate innovation. Over the years, the growth and success of our startups have always relied on the invaluable support of mentors who share their experience, knowledge, and vision with emerging teams. Our acceleration process has been built upon mentorship, and this collaboration has been the foundation of all our achievements to date. Today, after our successful journey in Iran, our path has expanded to Toronto and now to Vancouver, Canada. We continue to believe that the future of entrepreneurship is built through the guidance, inspiration, and dedication of mentors who are passionate about empowering the next generation of entrepreneurs."
